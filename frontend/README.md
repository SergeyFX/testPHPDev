# Frontend Vue.js

Vue.js V3 with PrimeVue v4

Create a basic search form that will query the API using AJAX and display the results it receives from the backend. The search result should be rendered to an HTML table dynamically on the frontend, using reactive Vue.js

There should be some sort of search indicator, a spinning icon or something similar. 
 
A message should be displayed if no results are found.
